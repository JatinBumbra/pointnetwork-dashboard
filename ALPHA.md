## Installation

### Mac OS

1. Download the latest release here: https://github.com/pointnetwork/pointnetwork-dashboard/releases (yours is with the suffix **-mac**), unpack and install
2. Try to run it first, but it is not signed for now so it will not be able to run
3. Now you can allow it to run: Settings -> Security & Privacy -> General -> click on the lock -> "Open Anyway"
4. See "After Installation" section below

### Windows

1. Download the latest release here: https://github.com/pointnetwork/pointnetwork-dashboard/releases (yours is with the suffix **-win**), unpack and install
2. See "After Installation" section below

### Linux

1. Download the latest release here: https://github.com/pointnetwork/pointnetwork-dashboard/releases (the one depends on your OS), unpack and install
2. See "After Installation" section below

## After Installation

1. Just follow the instructions for Point Dashboard
2. When you register a new secret phrase, and you want to test it again, don't lose it - it will qualify you to be on the list of alpha testers. Next time, you can just *log in* with this phrase instead of registering more one
3. Please report back to the group with screenshots, everyone would love to see each other's progress! https://t.me/pointnetworkchat
